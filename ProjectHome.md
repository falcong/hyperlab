Hyperlab allows the user to create his own constructive, perturbative or mixed hyper-heuristics and test them against other implemented hyper-heuristics and across multiple problem domains. Three problem domains are already implemented and contain both constructive and perturbative heuristics: bin packing, graph coloring and tsp. Hyperlab has auxiliary libraries for tabu search, genetic algorithm and choice function. It also has a benchmarking library, and an analyzer application to help visualize the data generated.
